Hi! My name is Henry Nadel. I am currently in my final year at Pitzer College where I study Environmental Analysis on a public policy track with an additional minor in Data Science. I am particularly interested in how data informs public policy, using graphing and GIS to make information accessible, and community organizing. When I'm not in the classroom I can usually be found outside on my bike, climbing, or exploring one of California’s many parks.

Currently: Senior at Pitzer College\
Major: Environmental Analysis; Minor: Data Science\
Based in: Claremont, CA\
Originally from: Newton, MA

### This Website

I initally built this website as a project for my intro to Data Science class to showcase projects in data gathering and analysis I had completed through the course. These projects are not compiled inter the "Data Vis" tab in the navigation bar. Since then, I have continued adding to the website with other work I was excited to showcase. As a fun addition, the last tab showcases some of my favorite photographs from the semester I spent studying abroad in Nepal. I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
