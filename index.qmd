# Welcome

Hi! My name is Henry Nadel. I am currently in my final year at Pitzer College where I study Environmental Analysis on a public policy track with an additional minor in Data Science. I am particularly interested in using data to inform public policy along with using graphing and GIS software to convey data in an accessible manner. When I'm not in the classroom I can usually be found outside, running, climbing, or exploring one of Californiaâ€™s amazing parks.

- Currently: Senior at Pitzer College  
- Focus areas: Major: Environmental Analysis; Minor: Data Science  
- Based in: Claremont, CA  
- Originally from: Newton, MA
