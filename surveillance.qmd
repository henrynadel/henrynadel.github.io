The following is the final paper for a class I took in the fall of 2025, Surveillance in the Media. We were tasked with writing a ~3000 word research paper on a modern surveillance technology contextualized using scholarship including and expanding upon course readings. From there, we were asked to consolidate our research into a shorter format, specifically catered to the goal of communication our findings to a public audience. This second iteration is displayed below, including the citation list for the full research paper.
