The following is a study that I conducted in fall of 2024 in collaboration with the Warehouse Worker Resource Center looking to measure the how, where, and when the warehousing industry has grown in Los Angeles and the Inland Empire from 1980 - 2024. The research breaks down growth trends at the regional, county, and city level. 

The research here is not peer reviewed nor academically published, data analysed is open source from the [WarehouseCITY dataset](https://radicalresearch.shinyapps.io/WarehouseCITY/), and all other sources are listed in the bibliography.
