My name is Henry Nadel. I am currently in my final year at Pitzer College where I study Environmental Analysis on a public policy track with an additional minor in Data Science. I am particularly interested in using data to inform public policy along with using graphing and GIS software to convey data in an accessible manner. When I’m not in the classroom I can usually be found outside, running, climbing, or exploring one of California’s amazing parks.\n\nCurrently: Senior at Pitzer College\n\nFocus areas: Major: Environmental Analysis; Minor: Data Science\n\nBased in: Claremont, CA\n\nOriginally from: Newton, MA\n\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\n\n\nWelcome\n[]\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
