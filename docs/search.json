    "text": "In the early 2010s, Target became widely known for using predictive analytics in ways that reshaped what retailers could infer from seemingly ordinary shopping patterns. As Charles Duhigg reported in The New York Times Magazine (2012), Target’s data science team analyzed years of transaction logs to detect subtle purchasing shifts—unscented lotion, certain supplements, cotton balls—that often correlated with early pregnancy. By combining these signals, the team built what they called a “pregnancy prediction” score and mailed coupons timed to a customer’s likely trimester (Duhigg, 2012).\nWhat stands out in this case is not simply the technical capability of the model, but the imbalance it created between the company and its customers. Most shoppers had no awareness that routine purchases could be interpreted as indicators of a private life event. The now-famous anecdote of the father who learned of his daughter’s pregnancy through Target’s mailed coupons illustrates this tension—predictive systems can surface intimate inferences long before individuals choose to share them. What Target described as personalization felt, to many, like an unexpected intrusion into family dynamics.\nJohn, Kim, and Barasz (2020) argue that cases like Target’s underscore the need for companies to “design for transparency,” suggesting that trust can be strengthened when consumers understand how their data is being used. Their point about transparency is valuable, but it may not fully resolve the discomfort raised by the Target example. Even if consumers knew more about the system, many would still object to a retailer using ordinary purchases to infer something as personal as pregnancy. In other words, the issue is not always misunderstanding—it is the nature of the inference itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuhigg (2012) explains that Target’s model was built by stitching together information from guest IDs, credit card transactions, coupons, website behavior, and store surveys. At no stage were customers explicitly asked whether this data could be used to generate predictions about pregnancy. Any “consent” technically existed only within broad loyalty-program disclaimers—documents that few people read, and that did not specify the possibility of intimate inferences being drawn from their behavior.\nJohn et al. (2020) argue that this falls short of meaningful consent, which they define as consent that involves clarity, purpose, and a sense of reciprocal benefit. The term “meaningful” here does not imply that Target violated its privacy policy—something we cannot determine from available reporting—but rather that customers had no reasonable way to anticipate how their data would be interpreted. The company may have met the minimal legal requirements of consent, but consumers lacked the information necessary to understand, let alone influence, how their purchasing behavior was being used.\nIt is also important to differentiate between inference and disclosure. While the mailed coupons did reveal something private, they did not make pregnancy status “fully public.” Instead, they introduced ambiguity and the possibility of unwanted inference within a household—something subtler than public disclosure but still ethically significant.\n\n\n\nTarget used a persistent “Guest ID” to link all aspects of a customer’s shopping life over time, effectively creating a long-term behavioral profile (Duhigg, 2012). Even if that ID was anonymized internally, the targeted coupons were sent to specific physical addresses, making the inference visible to anyone who handled the household mail. In practice, the model’s output moved beyond the database and into domestic space.\nJohn et al. (2020) suggest that transparency about data practices might improve consumer trust. But in this case, the discomfort does not stem from confusion about how data is used—it stems from the experience of being profiled in ways that feel intimate. Even a fully transparent system would still allow a company to infer something personal and then make that inference visible through marketing. The concern lies in the individualized nature of predictive profiling itself, not merely the lack of explanation around it.\n\n\n\nAccording to Duhigg (2012), the pregnancy model relied heavily on data from customers who had signed up for Target’s baby registry. This subset became the template for “pregnancy behavior,” despite representing only a fraction of expecting parents. People who paid in cash, shopped infrequently, or whose consumption patterns differed from registry users were more likely to be misclassified or overlooked entirely.\nJohn et al. (2020) describe this issue as a lack of “data empathy,” urging designers to consider people who fall outside the dominant patterns of a dataset. While that framing is helpful, it assumes that predictive analytics are inevitable and simply need to be fine-tuned. But in this case, the bias was not just a technical flaw—it reflected who Target considered worth identifying and targeting. The model made some pregnancies highly legible while others remained invisible, mirroring commercial priorities rather than offering a neutral representation of the population.\n\n\n\nTarget’s predictive system was not designed only to observe behavior—it aimed to shape it. Internally, marketers described pregnancy as a strategic moment for “habit formation,” when brand loyalty could be molded and strengthened (Duhigg, 2012). Predictive analytics here became a tool not just for anticipating future purchases but for subtly influencing them.\nJohn et al. (2020) imagine a future in which predictive analytics empower consumers and distribute agency more evenly. But this vision assumes a level of collaboration that is difficult to reconcile with existing retail incentives. When prediction is tied to profit, companies are rewarded for leveraging moments of vulnerability, not for sharing power with consumers. Target’s case shows how easily predictive capability becomes a mechanism of subtle influence rather than a shared resource.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Target case demonstrates how predictive analytics, when deployed without meaningful consent or safeguards, can deepen existing power imbalances. The company gained a competitive advantage through early detection of pregnancy and improved customer retention. For consumers, the harms were less visible but still significant: a loss of control over how personal information—and the inferences drawn from it—circulated within their lives.\nJohn et al. (2020) encourage us to think more broadly about who gets to shape predictive systems and what values guide their design. That framing is helpful, but only if we acknowledge that transparency alone cannot resolve the deeper structural issues. A model can meet high technical standards and still struggle ethically if the people affected by it have little say in how it operates or what boundaries it observes.\nAcross other data-driven systems, similar tensions appear. Technologies built for efficiency often overlook the realities of the people they act upon. Target’s system shows how predictive analytics, when operating quietly and without clear limits, can cross lines that individuals never had the opportunity to draw themselves. It’s a reminder that ethical data practices require more than accuracy or optimization—they require attention to how these systems shape everyday life.\n\n\n\n\nDuhigg, C. (2012).

Across every state shown above, Black and Hispanic drivers are searched at substantially higher rates than white drivers. This is especially pronounced in Connecticut and Rhode Island, where Black drivers face search rates around 7%, compared to roughly 3% for white drivers. Hispanic drivers show similarly elevated rates—around 6–7% in CT and RI.\nMassachusetts and Vermont have lower overall search activity, but the racial pattern still remains: Black and Hispanic drivers are searched more than white drivers, while Asian/Pacific Islander drivers consistently face the lowest search rates across the region. The “other” and “unknown” categories vary but rarely approach the higher search pressure placed on Black and Hispanic motorists. What emerges here is not just cross-state variation but a consistent structure: race strongly predicts the likelihood of being searched, and white drivers are the least likely to be searched in every state in the dataset."

The results tell a different story, one that goes against an assumption that higher search rates correspond to higher levels of contraband.\nAcross states, white drivers consistently show some of the highest contraband hit rates, especially in Vermont, where searches of white drivers turn up contraband nearly 90% of the time. Black and Hispanic drivers, who are searched far more often, show much lower hit rates—usually ranging from the high teens to the mid-40s depending on the state. This mismatch—higher search rates paired with lower hit rates—is especially stark in Connecticut and Rhode Island.\nIn short, the communities searched most aggressively are not the ones most likely to be found with contraband. Instead, white drivers, searched the least often, show the highest probability of a “successful” search.\nThis pattern displays a clear racial disparity in search rates, and shows that they are driven more by bias and over-policing, rather than by actual behavior."

    "text": "Conclusion\nBy merging four statewide datasets and visualizing search and hit rates, a clear pattern emerges: Black and Hispanic drivers are searched far more often, yet those searches uncover contraband less frequently than searches of white drivers.

That mismatch points toward discretionary enforcement shaped more by racial bias than by evidence. Even with New Hampshire excluded, the trend is unmistakable: search practices in these New England states fall unevenly along racial lines, and the data make that disparity impossible to explain away on the basis of “risk.\n\nDBI::dbDisconnect(con_traffic)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Abbasid Caliphate is heralded by many as the golden age of Islam for its cultural advancements and longevity lasting over three centuries that were defined by stability. However, their rise to power was far less idealistic and has been shrouded in apocalyptic mysteries by the Abbasids to create a cleaner narrative. Due to the swift nature of how the Abbasids took over the caliphate, along with the narrative control they claimed after their victory, it’s quite difficult to look past the historical descriptions written from within the Abbasid empire. However, piecing together the details from alternate sources, the story of a man named Abu Muslim begins to emerge. Abu Muslim played a critical role in the strategic mobilization of messianic aspirations that allowed the Abbasids to swiftly overtake the Ummayads, yet his story is seldom included. This paper aims to delineate Abu Muslim’s pivotal role, and in doing so, address how the interjection of Abu Muslim’s legacy alters our understanding of the eschatological dimensions inherent in the Abbasid Revolution. Through a nuanced analysis of historical narratives, ideology, and belief, this paper will show that contrary to the popular Abbasid narrative demonstrating the use of messianic expectation to gain power, in reality, the revolution was contingent on Abu Muslim’s role as a messianic figurehead.\nThe decline of the Umayyad Caliphate and the subsequent rise of the Abbasid Empire represents a seminal chapter in Islamic history, marked by political upheaval, social discontent, and religious fervor. Under Umayyad rule, which commenced in 661 CE, the Islamic empire experienced significant territorial expansion and consolidation of power. However, the Umayyad era was also characterized by growing dissatisfaction among non-Arab Muslims, socio-economic disparities, and religious opposition. Non-Arab Muslims, particularly Persians and converts from other regions, felt marginalized by the Arab elite, while economic grievances and resentment over taxation policies fueled social unrest.1\nConcurrently, as the masses became dissatisfied with the conditions they lived in under the Umayyad rule, oppositional religious groups were gaining popularity through their dispersal of messianic ideas. Historian Jacob Lassner stated clearly, “As Umayyad rule began to unravel, there was a seeming rise in messianic expectation.”2 This timely increase may be somewhat attributed to the inherent epochal nature of messianism in Islam, where the Mahdi will bring about a new era of prosperity. People can feel the Ummayad rule winding down, and with the impending end of a defining era for the arab world, there is of course the implied question of what will follow. Therefore, it is no huge leap for the hopeful, religious, or desperate to think that the end of the corrupt Umayyads could potentially usher in a new Messianic age.\nThis is the point in the story at which the two narratives begin to deviate. First, we will explore the side promoted by the Abbasid Caliphate, which is uncoincidentally the mainstream narrative adopted by historians. This narrative attributes the swift and decisive dismantling of the Umayad dynasty to a clandestine revolution orchestrated by the Abbasid family. The Abbasids were said to have connections to an underground network of revolutionaries, whom they were instructing to spread radical messianic ideology. This tactically planted the seeds of revolution among the common people of the Umayad Dynasty by pairing their political dissent with something to hope for. Lassner speaks more on this topic saying, “The marriage of a radical messianic message to revolutionary expectations is not unusual nor was it without its advantages to the house of ’Abbas. There was, after all, nothing to prevent abbasid propagandists from assuming a multitude of poses during the period of clandestine operations; they could thus appear as embracing all things to all peoples.”3 This interpretation from Lassner emphasizes both the intentionality behind the Abbasid’s Mahdist propaganda as well as how the underground nature of the operation allowed them to appeal to multiple groups by spreading inconsistent messages. Through strategic manipulation of religious symbolism and apocalyptic belief, the Abbasid authority undermined public faith in the Umayyad regime.\nThe Abbasids had successfully set the stage for a new Caliphate, now all that had to be done was to insert themselves into that role. This was done by strategically invoking their familial connection to the Prophet Muhammad through his uncle Abbas, thereby legitimizing their claim to the caliphate based on lineage. This genealogical tie provided the Abbasids with a powerful narrative of legitimacy, especially now appealing to an array of proto-Shi’ite groups who strongly believed in the importance of the Caliph being from the lineage of the prophet Muhammad.\nWith the tactical use of clandestine revolution, the Umayyad Caliphate was toppled swiftly and decisively. The people had been primed, waiting for a Mahdi figure to come and end the era of the Umayyad. So, when the Abbasids rode in with their black banners, opposing the white of the Umayyads, many were already on their side. The Abbasids effectively harnessed the energy of this apocalypticism paired with their lineage and within three years they controlled the entire Arabian Peninsula.\nThis narrative of the Abbasid revolution makes perfect sense when understanding the notion that history is written by the victors. It frames the Abbasids as tactful, powerful, and most of all in control of the workings that ultimately enabled their five-hundred-year Caliphate. As it applies to eschatological understanding, this telling teaches us that the invocation of the Mahdi symbol paired with the necessary lineage is enough to gain immense political power. This understanding places a lot of power on pure anticipation of the Mahdi, without necessitating the use of a prominent figurehead. But, this is not the complete narrative. What aspects of the transfer of power would the Abbasids prefer to be left out of the history books, and how does uncovering this information affect our understanding of the eschatological implications?\nThe first of those questions is easy to answer, clearly, from his lack of mention in their literature, the Abbasids would prefer we forget about Abu Muslim. However, while he may not be a focal point in the narrative of the Abbasid Revolution, his story was not lost. Abu Muslim’s early life and identity are shrouded in mystery and subject to conflicting accounts. He hailed from an obscure and non-Arab background, with various reports suggesting noble Persian descent or ties to the disowned Abbasid lineage.4 However, his own description of himself states, “I am a man from the muslimūn; I do not affiliate myself with any tribe to the exclusion of another.”5 This deliberate obscurity and clear allegiance to Islam frames him as a man of the people, with clear potential as a unifying force. As a young activist, Abu Muslim traversed the Iranian landscape, forging connections with disenfranchised groups and radical Shia sects. These are the same sects as those aforementioned for their role in spreading messianic anticipation. His association with the Banū’Ijl tribe and eventual entry into the Hāshimiyya organization (one of the Shi’ite sects),6 provided him with a platform to mobilize support and channel dissent against Umayyad rule. Described as, “charismatic, resolute, and high-minded,”7 with access to the Hāshimiyya, and a strategic mindset, Abu Muslim positioned himself as a key figure in the revolutionary movement.\nServing as a leader on behalf of the Hāshimiyya, who were religiously opposed to the Ummayad Caliphate, Abu Muslim traveled to Mecca in search of a riḍā (acceptable candidate) to serve as the next Imam. The person had to be from the lineage of the prophet Muhammad’s great-grandfather Hāshim, and once chosen, the new Imam would be backed by the Hāshimiyya. Assessing his options, the Alīds had the strongest historical and genealogical claim to legitimacy, whereas the Abbāsids had never previously exercised such a claim. However, unlike other members of the Hāshimiyya, Abu Muslim was not solely concerned with finding a riḍā. The Encyclopaedia of Islam states, “He was probably looking for the weakest claimant, the one least suspect of subversive or revolutionary intentions, connections, and/or capabilities and thus the candidate best suited to his designs.”8 Seemingly due to these reasons, he selected the Abbasids, cutting a deal with the son of their chief, Ibrāhīm al-Imām, whereby the Abbasids would bring religious leadership and legitimacy, and Abu Muslim would provide mobilized forces. If successful they would divide the spoils and split the land down the line of the Tigris River.9\nThis strategic alliance with the Abbasid family was the beginning of Abu Muslims’ ultimate ascension to power. Within a few weeks of returning from Mecca, he had effectively gained control of the Hāshimiyya, now holding immense influence over the masses who had been recently converted by the various Shi’ite sects spreading their messianic prophecies. With this final piece in place, he was ready for an open revolution.\nAbu Muslim’s overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate began with orchestrated rebellions in outlying districts, overpowering Arab garrisons, and destabilizing power centers like Merv. With minimal confrontation, Merv fell to Abu Muslim, signaling the collapse of Umayyad dominance in the eastern region.10 He then dispatched armies to abolish Umayyad rule in the West. There, his forces triumphantly entered Kufa, where he orchestrated a coup installing Abu al-Abbas al-Saffah, the youngest of the Abbasid brothers, as the first Abbasid caliph. As stated in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, “The amazing rapidity of the collapse of the Arab Umayyad military might in Khurāsān and Transoxania can be understood only by understanding Abū Muslim’s extraordinary strategy.”11 With al-Saffāḥ now serving as Caliph, and Abu Muslim maintaining governmental and military control, this marked the end of the Umayyad Caliphate and the rise of the Abbasid Dynasty.\nUnderstanding the hidden story of Abu Muslim, it feels clear in hindsight that the Abbasids would not have been able to gain control of the caliphate had they not initially been chosen by Abu Muslim, and later benefitted from his military prowess. Now, recognizing the integral role Abu Muslim played in the Abbasid Revolution, I feel compelled to ask the question, was he serving as a messianic figure?\nThe answer is not completely clear. Firstly, from all known accounts he never personally claimed to be the Mahdi or displayed much interest in religious leadership. However, ultimately he was the one to activate a massive buildup of messianic anticipation into a full blown revolution. He brought about the end of the Umayyad Caliphate as the Mahdi was expected to do, not to mention accounts of his charisma. So, even if he never officially claimed the title, from the lens of functionality, Abu Muslim played the role of a messianic figure in the Abbasid Revolution.\nUnderstanding Abu Muslim as a messianic figurehead who was integral in the success of the Abbasid Revolution completely reshapes our understanding of the eschatological implications at play. Previously, based on the Abbasid narrative, we are led to believe that due to the prophecy surrounding and lineage of the Abbasid, the messianic expectation, paired with some political unrest, was enough to start a revolution. However, Abu Muslim’s story shows us that is just not the case. On the contrary, the complete story of the Abbasid’s rise emphasizes the importance of having a figurehead in order to activate messianic belief among the public and create tangible change.\nSo, if Abu Muslim’s role in the Abbasid Revolution was so crucial, why is he missing from the Abbasid narrative? After dismantling the Umayad Caliphate and installing Abū l-’Abbās al-Saffāḥ as the first Abbasid Caliph, Abu Muslim began to rule alongside the Abbasids. Similarly to his reasons for choosing the Abbasid family in the first place, Abu Muslim intentionally chose al-Saffāḥ as the youngest and weakest of the eligible Abbasid brothers to be the first Caliph.12 Ruling alongside al-Saffāḥ allowed Abu Muslim to maintain the power he had gained in the Abbasid Revolution as the central leader. Throughout this period he was feared by the Abbasid family. However, although the initial claim to power felt contingent on the reputation of Abu Muslims, over the first few years of the dynasty Abbasid legitimacy had taken root, partially due to Abu Muslim’s efforts to cultivate it. Ultimately, after a five-year stint, Abū l- Abbās al-Saffāḥ was succeeded by his older brother, Abū Ja’far al-Manṣūr. The new Caliph did not take as kindly to the control of Abu Muslim as his younger brother. Seeing him as more of a threat than an asset, after eight months as Caliph, Al-Manṣūr covertly murdered Abu Muslim, finally allowing the Abbasids to take complete control of the caliphate.\nThe story of Abu Muslim, while often overshadowed by the mainstream narrative of the Abbasid Revolution, emerges as a crucial aspect in understanding the eschatological dimensions inherent in the rise of the Abbasid Empire. Through his strategic alliances and mobilization of messianic aspirations, Abu Muslim played a pivotal role in the swift overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate and the subsequent establishment of Abbasid rule. His deliberate obscurity and clear allegiance to Islam positioned him as a unifying force among the disenfranchised masses, ultimately leading to his instrumental role in orchestrating open revolution. While Abu Muslim may not have personally claimed the title of the Mahdi, his functional role as a messianic figurehead cannot be ignored. Understanding his integral role reshapes our understanding of the eschatological implications at play, emphasizing the importance of a figurehead in activating messianic belief and effecting tangible change. Despite his significant contributions, Abu Muslim’s absence from the Abbasid narrative serves as a classic example of revisionist history, where ending on top allows the Abbasids to paint their own picture, with themselves at the center. Abu Muslim reminds us that behind every dominant narrative lies a wealth of untold stories, waiting to reshape our understanding of the past."

    "text": "Discussion\nThis simulation suggests a negative relationship between warehouse construction and unemployment in the Los Angeles–San Bernardino–Riverside region from 1990 to 2023, meaning that in years when more warehouse square footage was built, unemployment rates tended to be lower. However, it’s important to note that while the null hypothesis was disproved, that doesn’t mean the initial data shown at the top has a strong linear correlation (which is why this data got scrapped from the project i was originally using it for)\nFurthermore, this result does not imply direct causation. Both variables may be influenced by larger economic cycles (e.g., recessions in 2008 and 2020). Still, this permutation study demonstrated a clear relationship in the data, that with the help of permutation testing we can now attribute to more than just chance."

It’s an interesting way to find many of the most common topics covered by the New York Times over the past three decades. Notably, the top three words stand distinctively above the rest in usage: Bush, Iraq, and War. this makes sense as all three of these words point to the same general event of President Bush’s decision to invade Iraq following 9/11. This makes sense as it was a large global event that took place near the beginning of this data’s period of observation. These findings make an interesting claim about how extensively the war in Iraq penetrated the American news cycle."

Interestingly, the list is dominated by Middle Eastern and European locations, while continents such as Africa and South America do not appear in the top ten at all, revealing something about the NYT’s geographic priorities and what kinds of crises receive sustained attention. Among U.S. locations, only New York and Florida make the list, pointing to the newspaper’s home base and what I would guess is the frequency of election-related stories tied to Florida. These counts measure the frequency of locations framed as settings (“in ___”), not total mentions, making the pattern a bit more precise in identifying where events are depicted as happening.\nIt is worth noting that many of these names have much higher tallies when counting total uses. The specific criteria of words following “in” is meant to isolate the places where stories are taking place opposed to total mentions, however, this does introduce a limitation to the findings of this table."
