Notably, the top three words stand distinctively above the rest in usage: Bush, Iraq, and War. this makes sense as all three of these words point to the same general event of President Bush’s decision to invade Iraq following 9/11. This makes sense as it was a large global event that toom place near the beginning of this data’s period of observation. These findings make an interesting claim about how extensively the war in Iraq penetrated the American news cycle."

It is worth noting that many of these names have much higher tallies when counting total uses. The specific criteria of words following “in” is meant to isolate the places where stories are taking place, opposed to total mentions."
