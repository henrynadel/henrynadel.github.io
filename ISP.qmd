The following is the independent study project that I conducted during the final month of my Pitzer in Nepal study abroad program in the spring of 2025. After 4 months based in the capital city of Kathmandu learning to speak Nepali, I left to Nepals northern district of Mustang, nestled along the Tibetan boarder. I stayed for three weeks in the town of Lubrak making friends with the locals and conducting research on the areas use of regional schooling which was garnering nationwide attention for the quality of schooling it was able to bring to a rural municipality. 

This research is not peer reviewed nor academically published. The first half of the paper is necessary background on the state of rural schooling across Nepal, and the second half holds my findings from Lubrak and the Muktinath region of Lower Mustang.

It was a great joy and honor to have spent the time I did in Mustang; Lubrak ko manche, sabailaai mero man choyo :)
