# Data Ethics — Predictive Analytics and Consumer Profiling at Target

## 1. Scenario Overview

In the early 2010s, Target became widely known for using predictive analytics in ways that reshaped what retailers could infer from seemingly ordinary shopping patterns. As Charles Duhigg reported in *The New York Times Magazine* (2012), Target’s data science team analyzed years of transaction logs to detect subtle purchasing shifts—unscented lotion, certain supplements, cotton balls—that often correlated with early pregnancy. By combining these signals, the team built what they called a “pregnancy prediction” score and mailed coupons timed to a customer’s likely trimester (Duhigg, 2012).

What stands out in this case is not simply the technical capability of the model, but the imbalance it created between the company and its customers. Most shoppers had no awareness that routine purchases could be interpreted as indicators of a private life event. The now-famous anecdote of the father who learned of his daughter’s pregnancy through Target’s mailed coupons illustrates this tension—predictive systems can surface intimate inferences long before individuals choose to share them. What Target described as personalization felt, to many, like an unexpected intrusion into family dynamics.

John, Kim, and Barasz (2020) argue that cases like Target’s underscore the need for companies to “design for transparency,” suggesting that trust can be strengthened when consumers understand how their data is being used. Their point about transparency is valuable, but it may not fully resolve the discomfort raised by the Target example. Even if consumers knew more about the system, many would still object to a retailer using ordinary purchases to infer something as personal as pregnancy. In other words, the issue is not always misunderstanding—it is the nature of the inference itself.

## 2. Ethical Analysis: Four Issue Areas

### A. Permission Structure & Consent

Duhigg (2012) explains that Target’s model was built by stitching together information from guest IDs, credit card transactions, coupons, website behavior, and store surveys. At no stage were customers explicitly asked whether this data could be used to generate predictions about pregnancy. Any “consent” technically existed only within broad loyalty-program disclaimers—documents that few people read, and that did not specify the possibility of intimate inferences being drawn from their behavior.

John et al. (2020) argue that this falls short of *meaningful* consent, which they define as consent that involves clarity, purpose, and a sense of reciprocal benefit. The term “meaningful” here does not imply that Target violated its privacy policy—something we cannot determine from available reporting—but rather that customers had no reasonable way to anticipate how their data would be interpreted. The company may have met the minimal legal requirements of consent, but consumers lacked the information necessary to understand, let alone influence, how their purchasing behavior was being used.

It is also important to differentiate between inference and disclosure. While the mailed coupons did reveal something private, they did not make pregnancy status “fully public.” Instead, they introduced ambiguity and the possibility of unwanted inference within a household—something subtler than public disclosure but still ethically significant.

### B. Data Collection Process & Identifiability

Target used a persistent “Guest ID” to link all aspects of a customer’s shopping life over time, effectively creating a long-term behavioral profile (Duhigg, 2012). Even if that ID was anonymized internally, the targeted coupons were sent to specific physical addresses, making the inference visible to anyone who handled the household mail. In practice, the model’s output moved beyond the database and into domestic space.

John et al. (2020) suggest that transparency about data practices might improve consumer trust. But in this case, the discomfort does not stem from confusion about how data is used—it stems from the experience of being profiled in ways that feel intimate. Even a fully transparent system would still allow a company to infer something personal and then make that inference visible through marketing. The concern lies in the individualized nature of predictive profiling itself, not merely the lack of explanation around it.

### C. Representativeness, Bias & Fairness

According to Duhigg (2012), the pregnancy model relied heavily on data from customers who had signed up for Target’s baby registry. This subset became the template for “pregnancy behavior,” despite representing only a fraction of expecting parents. People who paid in cash, shopped infrequently, or whose consumption patterns differed from registry users were more likely to be misclassified or overlooked entirely.

John et al. (2020) describe this issue as a lack of “data empathy,” urging designers to consider people who fall outside the dominant patterns of a dataset. While that framing is helpful, it assumes that predictive analytics are inevitable and simply need to be fine-tuned. But in this case, the bias was not just a technical flaw—it reflected who Target considered worth identifying and targeting. The model made some pregnancies highly legible while others remained invisible, mirroring commercial priorities rather than offering a neutral representation of the population.

### D. Unintended Uses & Influence of Power

Target’s predictive system was not designed only to observe behavior—it aimed to shape it. Internally, marketers described pregnancy as a strategic moment for “habit formation,” when brand loyalty could be molded and strengthened (Duhigg, 2012). Predictive analytics here became a tool not just for anticipating future purchases but for subtly influencing them.

John et al. (2020) imagine a future in which predictive analytics empower consumers and distribute agency more evenly. But this vision assumes a level of collaboration that is difficult to reconcile with existing retail incentives. When prediction is tied to profit, companies are rewarded for leveraging moments of vulnerability, not for sharing power with consumers. Target’s case shows how easily predictive capability becomes a mechanism of subtle influence rather than a shared resource.

## 3. Why This Matters: Who Benefits, Who Is Neglected or Harmed

The Target case demonstrates how predictive analytics, when deployed without meaningful consent or safeguards, can deepen existing power imbalances. The company gained a competitive advantage through early detection of pregnancy and improved customer retention. For consumers, the harms were less visible but still significant: a loss of control over how personal information—and the inferences drawn from it—circulated within their lives.

John et al. (2020) encourage us to think more broadly about who gets to shape predictive systems and what values guide their design. That framing is helpful, but only if we acknowledge that transparency alone cannot resolve the deeper structural issues. A model can meet high technical standards and still struggle ethically if the people affected by it have little say in how it operates or what boundaries it observes.

Across other data-driven systems, similar tensions appear. Technologies built for efficiency often overlook the realities of the people they act upon. Target’s system shows how predictive analytics, when operating quietly and without clear limits, can cross lines that individuals never had the opportunity to draw themselves. It’s a reminder that ethical data practices require more than accuracy or optimization—they require attention to how these systems shape everyday life.
